    <h1>
Why do prices sometimes change and move in unexpected directions, when fundamentals show a different result? - investors do not always behave rationally
</h1>
<div class="separator"></div>
<p>Traditional market theories explain how traders' behaviour affects   supply and demand, which influences asset prices. One of the foundations   for these theories is that investors trade rationally, according to   certain assumptions.</p>
<p>The problem is that when more and more   investors have access to the financial market there are also investors   that do not behave according to these assumptions. Instead they behave   according to their own rules or according to surrounding information,   hence becoming so called irrational investors. One of the key   characteristics of these irrational investors is that they are subject   to emotions involving markets and transactions, while rational investors   analyse and make decisions only according to fundamental theories.</p>
<p>Some theories consider investors to be   irrational to everyone that does not make investment decisions based on   &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; economical theories - not considering technical analysis   as an economical theory.</p>
<p>In a behavioural economy there are many   effects explaining on which foundations individuals make decisions, some   of which are described below:</p>
<p><strong>Bandwagon effect:</strong> <br>
  <em>Individuals make decisions according to the expectations of people surrounding them</em> <br>
  The Bandwagon effect is actually very common   behaviour, observable even on a daily basis. This effect relates to   situations where individuals make decisions according to the majority of   people surrounding them, and often not according to their own beliefs.   As mentioned before, this is a common effect used, between others, in   consumer economics trying to explain why people buy something because it   is trendy, even though for the consumer it&rsquo;s costly and is not a   necessary item, i.e. it is irrational. For markets, this effect may also   have very serious consequences, due to unconfirmed information (gossip,   speculation, or other types of information) which makes prices move   very sharply. </p>
<p><strong>Herd behaviour:</strong> <br>
  <em>Sometimes individuals make unplanned decisions according to group decisions</em> <br>
  The herd behaviour is very similar to the   bandwagon effect, but rather describes the actions (behaviour) of   individuals in a group. The main finding here is that individuals can   act as a group without a planned direction, which is observable during   market crashes or market bubbles when investors together increase the   effect of a crash or a bubble. </p>
<p><strong>Loss aversion - Disposition effect:</strong> <br>
  <em>Individuals prefer to cut profits and keep losses</em> <br>
  This behaviour exists when investors have a   tendency to sell assets when prices have increased, but will keep the   portfolio assets that have decreased in value. What this means is that   investors are less willing to recognise their losses than their profits,   which leads to extended losses in the portfolio. </p>
<p><strong>Focusing effect:</strong> <br>
  <em>When there is little information available, investors tend to rely on information with small significance</em> <br>
  This effect occurs when investors tend to rely   too much on one piece of information instead of the general situation.   This may have different reasons, for example one situation is when   investors are suffering losses, they want to believe that positive   information (rather insignificant in reality) will change the price   direction and they will start to profit. </p>
<p><strong>Optimism bias:</strong> <br>
  <em>Investors tend to be too optimistic</em> <br>
  This is the process when investors tend to be   too optimistic about the result for planned actions. Usually this means   that investors tend to overestimate the likelihood of positive events   and underestimate the likelihood of events with negative consequences. </p>
<p><strong>Ostrich effect:</strong> <br>
  <em>Some investors assume the denial posture related to negative events</em> <br>
  This is behaviour often seen in investors with   little experience, and it is a simple denial of negative situations. In   this situation, investors are so &ldquo;goal-focused&rdquo; that they do not accept   (deny) the existence of current or future negative events. </p>
<p><strong>Overconfidence effect:</strong> <br>
  <em>When taking profits investors tend to be overconfident</em> <br>
  In a way this effect is somewhat related to the   optimism bias, but in the case of the overconfidence effect investors   believe that their judgement of making decisions is high, compared with   their actual accuracy. This effect is even more observable when   confidence rises, which may result from obtaining some (higher than   usual) profits. </p>
<p><strong>Regret theory:</strong> <br>
  <em>Sometimes investors regret not having made a   transaction during prices peaks, so they will keep positions open in   order to make up for &ldquo;opportunity costs&rdquo;</em> <br>
  The regret theory takes into consideration the   reaction of individuals having realised they have made a mistake in   judgment. For example, sometimes investors regret not having closed an   open position at a certain price, that has turned out to be a market   extreme In such a case, it is a typical reaction to postpone the   decision of closing the transaction, in order to make up for lost   &ldquo;opportunity costs&rdquo;. <br>
  The typical consequence of such an approach is   that the investor tends to miss the opportunities that he or she would   take in other circumstances, and as a result, achieves a worse result   than in normal circumstances. </p>
