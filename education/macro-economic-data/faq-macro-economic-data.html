    <p><strong>Are there differences in formulas or the methodology between the   same macroeconomic indicators issued by different countries or regions,   such as the US and the euro zone?</strong><br>
      This question may be important for traders who   perform very detailed analyses. Indeed there are, most of the time,   differences between the same indicators, either in respect to the   precise formula applied, or in cases such as the CPI, the content of the   basket of goods used. On the other hand, in the case of every country   or region, there is always one official source that is responsible for   publication of the given data release, and one official set of data. As   the methodology used, in the case of most of the countries, has to meet   certain international quality standards, standard reports such as GDP or   the CPI can be compared between the different countries or regions.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there macroeconomic indicators that are unique for a given specific country?</strong><br>
      Macroeconomic indicators are constructed   according to the country&rsquo;s specifics. Therefore, there will be   indicators that regard only that country. Examples for this may be the   US Michigan report, or the IFO report from Germany. You can find more   indicators in our section related to macroeconomic data for the US or   for the euro zone.</p>
    <p><strong>Do only measurable macroeconomic indicators affect market prices?</strong><br>
      No, there are other very important indicators   affecting market prices. These can be confidence or sentiment opinions,   which economists sometimes try to present in a measurable way. Also   experts opinions may have significant influence on prices. You can see   what factors influence prices in our general market mechanics, our   section related to macroeconomic data for the US or for the euro zone.</p>
    <p><strong>How do changes in the prices of commodities affect currency prices?</strong><br>
      For commodity investors, currencies are just   instruments for performing transactions. Therefore, a rise or fall in   interest for commodities will result in a rise or fall in the prices of   currencies in which commodities are traded. For example, oil is traded   in USD, so an increase in demand for oil will lead to the appreciation   of the USD.</p>
    <p><strong>There is so much information published. What data should I focus on?</strong><br>
      This is a dilemma that many investors have, and   at the same time it is very difficult to give a precise answer.   Basically, one should follow the most influential information for a   specific asset, but also taking in account market activity. This is   because when the markets are very volatile, only the most &ldquo;important&rdquo;   macroeconomic information provides significant changes in prices, but   when the markets are rather stable usually less important news will   result in significant price movements. Our selection of information is   available in the general market mechanics section;</p>
    <p><strong>What is the difference between the US unemployment data and initial claims (jobless claims)?</strong><br>
      Initial claims or jobless claims is just a   fragment of the employment report. While unemployment data covers the   entire employment situation in the US, the jobless claims is a weekly   report showing only data related to insured unemployed individuals who   file claims (known as &ldquo;initial claims&rdquo;) when losing their jobs. Detailed   information on both reports may be found in our markets overview -   macroeconomic data section. </p>
    <p><strong>Which one is more important, fundamental or technical analysis?</strong><br>
      An investor should not treat both types of   analysis as one replacing another, but rather as complementary ones.   Usually fundamental theories are used for long-term investments, and   technical analysis for short-term investments; </p>
    <p><strong>Why does the condition of a country outside of euro zone sometimes affect euro prices?</strong><br>
      Trade relations do not focus mainly on countries   which are only within the euro zone, but also with countries outside -   not even those planning to enter the euro zone, like for example Russia,   United Kingdom, or even the US. This applies not only to the euro zone   but also to other countries like the United States. The close trading   links between the US and Latin American cause the US dollar to react to   the most important information concerning countries from that region.   More information is available in the general markets mechanics section   of our website or in the macroeconomic data section. </p>
    <p><strong>Why, during a speech of a top political official, do the prices of assets such as currencies sometimes shift very quickly?</strong><br>
      There are many factors affecting the price of   assets, not only those based on fundamental theories, but also others   affecting investors perspective of the market. They also include events   such as speeches of top political officials. More detailed information   is available in our general market mechanics. </p>
    <p><strong>With so much volatility on the financial markets, is the fundamental analysis useful?</strong><br>
      The fundamental analysis provides the   perspectives on the development of themarket situation in the longer   term. Typically, for short-term trading, investors usually use technical   analyses. However, one should never forget the fundamental foundations   which are used, even in the short-term when news is published. </p>
